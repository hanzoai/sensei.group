## Project Structure Analysis
- The project is a React application using Vite as the build tool.
- Routing is handled by react-router-dom with separate routes for marketing pages and account pages.
- UI components are organized by feature/page in the components directory.
- The navigation system uses dropdown menus for Products, Solutions, and Resources sections.

## Next Steps
1. Upgrade Node.js to a compatible version (v18+).
2. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are properly installed.
3. Address security vulnerabilities with `npm audit fix`.
4. Continue with feature development or bug fixes as needed.
